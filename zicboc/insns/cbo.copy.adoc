Description::

A *cbo.copy* instruction performs loads from the full set of bytes corresponding to the cache block whose effective address is the base address
specified in _rs1_, and stores that result to the full set of bytes corresponding to the cache block whose effective address is the base address
specified in _rs2_.
An implementation may or may not update the entire set of bytes atomically.
