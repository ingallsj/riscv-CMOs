== Introduction

_Cache-block-copy operation_ (or _CBO.COPY_) instruction performs its operation on
copies of data in the memory hierarchy. In general, CBO instructions operate on
cached copies of data, but in some cases, a CBO instruction may operate on
memory locations directly.

* A _copy_ instruction copies a range of memory locations, potentially
  allocating cached copies of data in one or more caches.

This document introduces the CBO Copy ISA extension that operates
specifically on cache blocks or the memory locations corresponding to a cache
block; these are known as _cache-block operation_ (or _CBO_) instructions.

* The _Zicboc_ extension defines a cache-block zero instruction: `CBO.COPY`

The execution behavior of the above instructions is also modified by CSR state
added by this specification.

The remainder of this document describes the above ISA extension.
